| The banquet hall of Computer Scientists' Palace has a rectangular form of the size M x N (1<=M<=9, 1<=N<=9). It is necessary to lay hardwood floors in the hall. There are wood pieces of two forms:
| 1) rectangles (2x1) 
| 2) corners (squares 2x2 without one 1x1 square) 
| You have to determine X - the number of ways to cover the banquet hall. 
| Remarks. The number of pieces is large enough. It is not allowed to leave empty places, or to cover any part of a surface twice, or to saw pieces.

**Input**

The first line contains natural number M. The second line contains a natural number N.

**Output**

First line should contain the number X, or 0 if there are no solutions.
