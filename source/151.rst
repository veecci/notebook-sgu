===========================
``time limit per test: 0.25 sec / memory limit per test: 4096 KB``

Find coordinates of any triangle ABC if it is know that |AB|=c, |AC|=b, |AM|=m, AM is a median of triangle.

**Input**

There are three real numbers in input: c, b, m (0<c,b,m<=10^3) separated by a space. Length of the fractional part of each number is not greater than 2 digits.

**Output**

If solution exists, write three lines. Write coordinates of point A to first line, coordinates of B to second line and coordinates of C to third line. Separate numbers by a space; absolute value of each coordinate must not exceed 10^4. Write numbers with 5 digits after decimal point. If there is no solution, write "Mission impossible"
