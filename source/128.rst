| There are N points given by their coordinates on a plane. All coordinates (xi,yi) are integers in a range from -10000 up to 10000 inclusive . It is necessary to construct a broken line satisfying the following conditions:
| 1. The broken line should be closed.
| 2. End points of each segment (verteces) of the broken line can only be the given points, and all given points should be used.
| 3. Each two consecutive segments of the broken line should form a corner of 90 degrees in each vertex point.
| 4. The sides of the broken line should be parallel to coordinate axes.
| 5. The broken line should have no self-crossing and self-contact.
| 6. The broken line should have the minimal length.
| You have to either find the length L of the constructed broken line, or determine that it is impossible to construct such a broken line.

**Input**

First line contains the number N (4 <= N <= 10000) - amount of points. Each of the following N lines contains coordinates of points separated by space xi and yi (1 <= i <= N). Points are given in random order.

**Output**

First line should contain the length of the broken line L or 0 if there is no solution.
