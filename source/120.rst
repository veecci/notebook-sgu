==================
``time limit per test: 0.25 sec / memory limit per test: 4096 KB``

Archipelago Ber-Islands consists of N islands that are vertices of equiangular and equilateral N-gon. Islands are clockwise numerated. Coordinates of island :math:`N_1` are :math:`(x_1, y_1)`, and island :math:`N_2` â€“ :math:`(x_2, y_2)`. Your task is to find coordinates of all N islands.



**Input**

In the first line of input there are N, :math:`N_1` and :math:`N_2` ( :math:`3 \le N \le 150, 1 \le N_1, N_2 \le N, N1 \neq N2`) separated by spaces. On the next two lines of input there are coordinates of island :math:`N_1` and :math:`N_2` (one pair per line) with accuracy 4 digits after decimal point. Each coordinate is more than -2000000 and less than 2000000.



**Output**

Write N lines with coordinates for every island. Write coordinates in order of island numeration. Write answer with 6 digits after decimal point.
