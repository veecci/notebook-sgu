186. The Chain
================
``time limit per test: 0.25 sec / memory limit per test: 4096 KB``

| Smith has N chains. Each chain is the sequence of successively connected links. The length of each chain is known: the first chain contains L1 links, the second - L2, ..., the last one - LN. 
| He can make a following series of actions in a minute: 
| 1.	to unchain one link 
| 2.	to remove or to put into the unchained link some other links of any chain 
| 3.	to chain the link 
| Your task is to determine the minimum time which will take the smith to connect all the chains in one line, i.e. the chain will look like a chain made up of successively connected links.

**Input**

The first line contains natural number N<=100. The second line contains L1, L2, ..., LN (1<=Li<=100, for all i = 1..N).

**Output**

Output the only integer number - the solution to the problem.
