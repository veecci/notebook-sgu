Let us call P(n) - the product of all digits of number n (in decimal notation). 
For example, P(1243)=1*2*4*3=24; P(198501243)=0. 
Let us call n to be a good number, if (p(n)<>0) and (n mod P(n)=0). 
Let us call n to be a perfect number, if both n and n+1 are good numbers. 

You are to write a program, which, given the number K, counts all such 
numbers n that n is perfect and n contains exactly K digits in decimal notation.

**Input**

Only one number K (1<=K<=1000000) is written in input.

**Output**

Output the total number of perfect k-digit numbers.
