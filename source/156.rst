====================
``time limit per test: 0.25 sec / memory limit per test: 4096 KB``

| Let us consider an undirected graph G = <V, E>. We say that two vertices u and v are neighbours if (u, v) in E. In this case we also say that u is a neighbour of v and v is a neighbour of u. Let us denote by N(v) the set of neighbours of v. Recall that the number of neighbours of v is called the degree of this vertex and is denoted by deg v. 
| We call graph G strange if it is connected and for its every vertex v the following conditions are satisfied: 
|  1. deg v >= 2 (i.e. there are at least two neighbours of v) 
|  2. if deg v = 2 then the two neighbours of v are not connected by an edge 
|  3. if deg v > 2 then there exists u in N(v), such that the following is true: 
|    (a) deg u = 2 
|    (b) any two diRerent vertices w1, w2 in N(v) \ {u} are neighbours, i.e. (w1,w2) in E 
| You are given some strange graph G. Find a hamiltonian cycle in it, i.e. a cycle that goes through every vertex of G exactly once.

**Input**

The first line of the input file contains two integer numbers N and M - the number of vertices and edges in G respectively (3 <= N <= 10000, M <= 100000). 2M integer numbers follow - each pair represents vertices connected by the corresponding edge (vertices are numbered from 1 to N). It is guaranteed that each edge occurs exactly once in the input file and that there are no loops (i.e. ends of each edge are distinct).

**Output**

If there is no hamiltonian cycle in G, print -1 in the first line of the output file. In the other case output N numbers - the sequence of vertices of G as they appear in the hamiltonian cycle found (note that the last vertex must be connected to the first one). If there are several solutions, output any one.
