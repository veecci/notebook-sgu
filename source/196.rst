============================
``time limit per test: 0.25 sec / memory limit per test: 65536 KB``

Let us consider an undirected graph G = <V, E> which has N vertices and M edges. Incidence matrix of this graph is an N × M matrix A = { :math:`a_{ij}`}, such that :math:`a_{ij}` is 1 if i-th vertex is one of the ends of j-th edge and 0 in the other case. Your task is to find the sum of all elements of the matrix :math:`A^TA` where :math:`A^T` is A transposed, i.e. an M × N matrix obtained from A by turning its columns to rows and vice versa. 

**Input**

The first line of the input file contains two integer numbers — N and M ( :math:`2 \le N \le 10,000, 1 \le M \le 100,000`). 2M integer numbers follow, forming M pairs, each pair describes one edge of the graph. All edges are different and there are no loops (i.e. edge ends are distinct). 

**Output**

Output the only number — the sum requested.
