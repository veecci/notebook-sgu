Extraordinary things are around us! All citizens of democratic Berland provided election of president and nobody voted "against all candidates". All votes distributed between N candidates. You was charged to write a program to calculate the results of election. You must indicate a part of votes given to each of the candidates. You must write integer numbers, concidering two conditions: 
| - Total sum of parts must be exactly 100% 
| - Every part is an integer number and it must be equal to real part, rounded up or down.

**Input**

There is a natural number N (1<=N<=10000) written in the first line - amount of candidates. Second line contains sequence of non-negative integer numbers A1, A2,..., AN; Ai is amount of votes given to the i-th candidate (Ai<=10000). Numbers of sequence are separated by one or more spaces.

**Output**

Write sequence of sought parts. Separate numbers by a space. If solution does not exist, write "No solution". If there are several solutions write any of them.

**Example(s)**
