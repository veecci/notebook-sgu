130. Circle
==============
``time limit per test: 0.25 sec / memory limit per test: 4096 KB``

On a circle border there are 2k different points A1, A2, ..., A2k, located contiguously. These points connect k chords so that each of points A1, A2, ..., A2k is the end point of one chord. Chords divide the circle into parts. You have to find N - the number of different ways to connect the points so that the circle is broken into minimal possible amount of parts P.


**Input**

The first line contains the integer k (1 <= k <= 30).

**Output**

The first line should contain two numbers N and P delimited by space.
