140. Integer Sequences
========================
``time limit per test: 0.25 sec / memory limit per test: 4096 KB``

A sequence A is called an integer sequence of length N if all its elements :math:`A_1 A_2 .. A_N` are non-negative integers less than 2 000 000 000. Consider two integer sequences of length N, A and X. The result of their multiplication (A*X) is an integer number :math:`R=A_1*X_1 + A_2*X_2 + .. + A_N*X_N`. Your task is to solve the equation A*X=B (mod P), given the integer sequence A and the integer numbers B and P.

**Input**

The first line contains the integer numbers N (1<=N<=100) - the length of the integer sequences - P (1<=P<=10 000) and B (0<=B<=P-1). The second line contains the elements of the sequence A, separated by blanks: :math:`A_1 A_2 .. A_N`.



**Output**

You should print one line containing the word "YES" if there exists at least one integer sequence X which is a solution to the equation, or print "NO" otherwise. If the answer is "YES", the next line should contain N non-negative integers separated by blanks: :math:`X_1 X_2 .. X_N`.
