You task is to find minimal natural number N, so that N! contains exactly Q zeroes on the trail in decimal notation. As you know N! = 1*2*...*N. For example, 5! = 120, 120 contains one zero on the trail.

**Input**

One number Q written in the input (0<=Q<=10^8).

**Output**

Write "No solution", if there is no such number N, and N otherwise.
