| There is a syntactically correct boolean expression. 
| The definition of syntactically correct expression follows as: 
| 1) "a","b","c",...,"j" are syntactically correct expressions. 
| 2) If A is a correct expression, then !A and (A) are correct expressions too. 
| 3) If A is a correct expression and B is a correct expression, then A||B, A&B;, A<=>B, A=>B, A#B are syntactically correct expressions too. 
| Syntactically correct expression doesn't contain spaces. 
| Small Latin letters are variables, ! denotes negation, || - disjunction, & - conjunction, <=> - equality, => - implication, # - excepting or. 
| Negation has the highest priority, conjunction has middle priority, and other operations have low priority. Brackets change the order of operations executing. 
| Two expressions are called identical if their values are the same in any values of variables. 
| Make the expression, which will be identical with given expression. New expression must be free of brackets.

**Input**

Single line of input contains the correct expression; its length does not exceed 2048 symbols. Variables are denoted by small Latin letters from 'a' to 'j'.

**Output**

In the first line of output write the sought for expression. Its length must not exceed 32768 symbols.
