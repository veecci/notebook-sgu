135. Drawing Lines
=====================
``time limit per test: 0.25 sec / memory limit per test: 4096 KB``

Little Johnny likes to draw a lot. A few days ago he painted lots of straight lines on his sheet of paper. Then he counted in how many zones the sheet of paper was split by these lines. He noticed that this number is not always the same. For instance, if he draws 2 lines, the sheet of paper could be split into 4, 3 or even 2 (if the lines are identical) zones. Since he is a very curious kid, he would like to know which is the maximum number of zones into which he can split the sheet of paper, if he draws N lines. The sheet of paper is to be considered a very large (=infinite) rectangle.

**Input**

The input file will contain an integer number: N (0<=N<=65535).

**Output**

You should output one integer: the maximum number of zones into which the sheet of paper can be split if Johnny draws N lines.
