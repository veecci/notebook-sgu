133. Border
==============
``time limit per test: 0.25 sec / memory limit per test: 4096 KB``

Along the border between states A and B there are N defence outposts. For every outpost k, the interval [ :math:`A_k,B_k`] which is guarded by it is known. Because of financial reasons, the president of country A decided that some of the outposts should be abandoned. In fact, all the redundant outposts will be abandoned. An outpost i is redundant if there exists some outpost j such that :math:`A_j<A_i` and :math:`B_i<B_j`. Your task is to find the number of redundant outposts.

**Input**

The first line of the input will contain the integer number N (1<=N<=16 000). N lines will follow, each of them containing 2 integers: :math:`A_k` and :math:`B_k` (0 <= :math:`A_k` < :math:`B_k` <= 2 000 000 000), separated by blanks. All the numbers :math:`A_k` will be different. All the numbers :math:`B_k` will be different.

**Output**

You should print the number of redundant outposts.
