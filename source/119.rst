*“Prove that for any integer X and Y if 5X+4Y is divided by 23 than 3X+7Y is divided by 23 too.”* The task is from city Olympiad in mathematics in Saratov, Russia for schoolchildren of 8-th form. 2001-2002 year. 

For given N and pair :math:`(A_0, B_0)` find all pairs (A, B) such that for any integer X and Y if :math:`A_0X+B_0Y` is divided by N then AX+BY is divided by N too (0<=A,B<N).


**Input**

Each input consists of positive integer numbers N, :math:`A_0` and :math:`B_0 (N,A_0,B_0 \le 10000)` separated by whitespaces.

**Output**

Write number of pairs (A, B) to the first line of output. Write each pair on a single line in order of non-descreasing A (and B in case of equal A). Separate numbers by single space.

**Example(s)**
